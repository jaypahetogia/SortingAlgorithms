Learning &amp; practising sorting algorithms

Comparing Bubble sort, Insertion sort, and Selection sort
Each sorting algorithm sorts through a randomized data size of 100 integers
nanoTime is recorded for each time it takes to sort through the data, and printed on console
Experiment is repeated for reverse ordered data, slightly organized data, and completely unorganized data
